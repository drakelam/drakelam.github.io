						<h2 id="developer-la-gi">1. What is developer?</h2>
						<p>"Developer" is the calling of a programmer, also known as software engineer. These are the people who will use programming languages to design, build, and maintain computer programs. It can be said that "Developer" is the one who directs and processes the programming code to create the most complete and innovative computer software. They are the key to the development of any software application.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" lazyloaded" src="../../../pictures/images/developer-la-gi.jpg" alt="Developer l&agrave; g&igrave;?" width="800" height="533" data-src="/pictures/images/developer-la-gi.jpg" /></p>
						<p>"Developers" proficient in computer programming skills may become very famous, but that may be limited by the scope in the field of software engineering. Quite a few reputable programmers are labeled hackers. Programmers often associate the image of IT professionals with corporate uniforms and must follow certain rules and regulations. And today, there are many young but good programmers who are considered the seeds of the programming industry of the future.</p>
						<h2 id="nhung-cong-viec-cua-mot-developer">2. The works of a "Developer"</h2>
						<p>To make software, the job of a "Developer" is first to create a blueprint, each programmer takes on a different part and then the parts will be connected together, creating into a complete product. A programmer is considered a "coding" - A person typing commands on a computer and making software or editing, developing software applications based on programming tools.</p>
						<p>The work of "Developer" includes: Web programming, game programming, system programming, database programming and mobile programming with the main tasks as:</p>
						<p>- Perform construction, design a new application.</p>
						<p>- Carry out upgrades, repairs, and improvements to existing applications.</p>
						<p>- Building a system of application processing functions.</p>
						<p>- Research and develop new technology applications.</p>
						<p>Specifically, programmers will have to do the following jobs:</p>
						<p>- Write programs in many languages ​​such as C ++, Java, ...</p>
						<p>- Update and expand the available programs: the programmer's job is quite close to the work of the software developer, when problems arise, the programmer can also do and handle the software developer work, eg program design.</p>
						<p>- Programmer will be the debugger for the programs by checking for errors and fixing them.</p>
						<p>- Build and use computer-aided software tools to automatically encode a piece of code.</p>
						<p>Use code libraries to simplify documents.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="lazyload" src="../../../images/load.gif" alt="C&ocirc;ng việc ủa Developer" width="800" height="650" data-src="/pictures/images/cong-viec-cua-lap-trinh-vien.jpg" /></p>
						<h2 id="nhung-cap-bac-cua-mot-developer">3. Ranks of a "Developer"</h2>
						<p>Not all programmers have the same qualifications, to become an excellent "Developer" you will have to go through a long and arduous process of learning and practice. Starting from lower levels gradually develops, raising the level up to higher levels. The developer levels include:</p>
						<p>The first is Junior Developer: This is a job that requires less than 3 years of professional experience, overall understanding of databases, application lifecycle and writing of basic applications.</p>
						<p>- The second is Senior Developer: This position requires from 4 to 10 years of experience, has a deeper knowledge of the profession and can program complex applications.</p>
						<p>- Third is Leader Developer: This position requires you to have 7-10 years of experience and have the skills of a professional senior developer, able to do all the work as a software engineer. stand alone or lead a group of programmers.</p>
						<p>- Fourth is Mid - level Manager - middle manager: This is the person who will manage the programmer and work under the senior management. In some organizations, they have the right to hire and fire their employees. At this level, the titles are: Product Manager, Project Manager, ...</p>
						<p>- Finally, Senior Leader - senior manager: This is the leader of his subordinate management and the person who will report the results directly to the director of the company. The positions at this level include: VP, CTP or CEO.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="lazyload" src="../../../images/load.gif" alt="C&aacute;c cấp bậc của Developer" width="800" height="533" data-src="/pictures/images/junior-developer.jpg" /></p>
						<h2><strong>4. Necessary skills of a "Developer"</strong></h2>
						<p>Programmers are a profession that requires a lot of important skills, the qualities needed to be able to undertake and complete the job in the best way. That is:</p>
						<p>- Carefulness, meticulousness at work: With the complex nature, always working with data and code, it requires programmers to always work the most carefully, pay attention to every detail. . Because any small error in the working process will cause your product problems and moreover cause the work schedule to be interrupted, it takes a lot of time to fix it.</p>
						<p>Programmers have the ability to work independently and work in groups: Often programmers will be assigned certain jobs, separately and have to work independently. However, after each project, you will have to connect with others to create a finished product. Therefore, it requires programmers to have both independent working skills and the ability to work in teams to complete the work in the best way.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="lazyload" src="../../../images/load.gif" alt="Kỹ năng l&agrave;m việc nh&oacute;m" width="800" height="523" data-src="/pictures/images/ky-nang-lam-viec-nhom(1).jpg" /></p>
						<p>- Having good aesthetic eyes, good design ability and creative thinking: This is a very important quality to have for a Developer. To be able to create a quality product requires you to have aesthetics and the ability to design and think logically.</p>
						<p>- Time management skills: A professional Developer must know how to manage his working time to arrange and give an estimate of the time required to complete the job.</p>
						<p>Always be patient: Problems that programmers have to solve are often the ones that are difficult and cannot be solved immediately, taking a lot of time and effort. It can take hours, days, even weeks to months to find the right direction. Therefore, if there is no patience, it is difficult to pursue this profession.</p>
						<p>- Always self-study, hone and improve specialized skills and knowledge: Programming is difficult, but it is harder to maintain it. Therefore, you must always improve your knowledge, improve your own level, have the opportunity to further advance at work.</p>
						<h2>5. Where can "developers" work?</h2>
						<p>With the speed of development of science and technology, programmers are a profession that many few employers and companies welcome. Job opportunities in this industry are very wide, in many different fields. Therefore, learning to code is a wise choice for young people with passion and capacity in technology. Because they will have the opportunity to develop themselves, find a perfect job, suitable for their abilities and have an attractive income. With a degree in programming, you can work in some of the following places:</p>
						<h2>5.1. Outsourcing companies</h2>
						<p>Outsourcing companies' advantage lies in the professional environment and the opportunity to participate in large foreign projects. This is especially useful for young graduates who put themselves under the pressure of a big project to help programmers quickly absorb and get used to the job, creating professionalism for themselves.</p>
						<p>However, for the outsourcing environment, you will also face certain limitations, that the number of worthy projects is small as well as paying fixed costs per capita at companies. "Developers" get frustrated quickly and easily give up. Therefore, it is necessary to practice patience to be able to seize opportunities and bring success to themselves.</p>
						<h2>5.2. Start-up companies</h2>
						<p>The young start-up environment is an advantage for new programmers who do not have too much experience. However, for this environment, you will have to work more than 100% of your ability. Besides, because the amount of work here will be a lot and the human resource is limited, it will require you to have many more things that are not part of your knowledge equipped at large companies. Working in such environments will make you much more mature.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="lazyload" src="../../../images/load.gif" alt="C&ocirc;ng ty start-up" width="800" height="533" data-src="/pictures/images/cong-ty-start-up.jpg" /></p>
						<p>It is evident that start-ups will have a lot of shortcomings and limitations. The first is that the success rate is quite low, so being able to stick with these companies for a long time is not high and it can take a lot of time, effort as well as your own opportunities. Therefore, if you are a tech savvy person, you should consider such companies.</p>
						<h2>5.3. Multinational companies</h2>
						<p>The position of programmer for these companies is probably not much because most nowadays still see Vietnam as a distribution and consumption market. However, in recent years, the Vietnamese market begins to get bigger and proves the potential position of the industry in the future.</p>
						<p>Multinational companies with a very methodical working process, so programmers working here only need to have a certain focus and direction, have passion and want to try and dig into one. spearhead technology. In addition, working in this environment will help programmers expand their knowledge and vision because they will mainly work with international businesses.</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="lazyload" src="../../../images/load.gif" alt="C&ocirc;ng ty đa quốc gia" width="800" height="468" data-src="/pictures/images/cong-ty-da-quoc-gia.jpg" /></p>
						<h2>5.4. State companies and organizations</h2>
						<p>Working in state-owned companies will be quite leisurely, the job will be less pressure and more difficult, but the salary is not high compared to the market. However, it also has certain intangible values ​​and great potentials in the future, especially at present, the state still holds an important role in the country's economy.</p>
						<p>Each company, working environment has different advantages and disadvantages. However, for the current information technology market, it is not easy to find a job suitable for your own capabilities. Especially for newly graduated students, it will be difficult for them to determine their right passions and goals. Therefore, sometimes it takes to go through a number of jobs in different companies to determine what you want to pursue, which is the right job for you.</p>
